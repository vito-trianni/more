This repository provides the source code for the experiments presented within
the paper "Advantages of multi-objective optimisation in evolutionary robotics:
survey and case studies" by Vito Trianni and Manuel López-Ibáñez.

The repository contains:
1. the ARGoS simulation framework - version 2 (simulator). For an update version,
   see http://www.argos-sim.info
2. supporting files for the simulator (common/utility)
3. the control interface for several robotic platform (common/control-interface)
4. the user experiments run in the context of the paper (user/)
5. a snapshot of the Shark Machine Learning Library (version 2.3.0) patched to
   support multi-objective maximisation - the latest library version is available
   at http://image.diku.dk/shark/sphinx_pages/build/html/index.html

The software compiles with gcc/g++ version 4.4, and has not been tested/updated
for later versions. The software has been tested on a Ubuntu distribution 
(Ubuntu 14.04 LTS trusty). No support is provided for different configurations.
