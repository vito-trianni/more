/**
 * @file common/control_interface/handbot/ci_handbot_gripper_cameras.h
 *
 * @brief This file provides the definition of the handbot cameras in the grippers
 * The cameras in the hand-bot's gripper are RGB cameras, that can capture an image of
 * 640X480 pixels (we refer to it as Camera-Image).
 * The camera can work in 4 modalities: black and white, RGB, black ad white with edge
 * detection, RGB with edge detection. At the moment of writing the 2 black and white modalities
 * do not work (ASEBA complains at compile time).
 *
 * Given the limited amount of memory on the PIC, only a portion of the Camera-Image can
 * be copied from the sensor to the micro controller. ASEBA's native camera functions
 * allow to define a sampling interval in terms of pixels (vertical and horizontal). By doing this a subset of
 * the Camera-Image is copied on the PIC (we refer to it as PIC-Image).
 *
 * In addition, the PIC-Image cannot be sent on the bus, as it would
 * saturate it and ASEBA would crash. Therefore only a line of the PIC-IMage is
 * sent through an ASEBA event so that it can be used in the robot's controller.
 * This information is not sent every control step, but only at fixed intervals.
 *
 * The PIC-Image line that is sent on the bus can be selected by the user.
 *
 * The parameters of the camera (sempling intervals, camera mode) cannot be selected
 * by the user, as the robot could crash if the setup is wrong. We decided to embed
 * the camera tuning inside the aseba backend, and leave to the user only the choice
 * on which line is sent on the bus.
 *
 * Resuming:
 *
 * 640X480 image is sampled before being stored on the PIC.
 * Only a line of the image on the PIC is sent on the bus.
 * This line is sent at fixed intervals, skipping some control cycles.
 * The line sent on the bus can be selected by the user.
 * Other camera parameters are pre-selected in the aseba backend.
 * 
 *
 * Currently the camera samples 80 pixels on the horizontal direction (1 every 8)
 * and 15 lines on the vertical direction (1 every 32). The camera mode is set
 * to RGB ith edge detection. Therefore the user receives 80 pixels from the selected
 * line (1 of the possible 15).
