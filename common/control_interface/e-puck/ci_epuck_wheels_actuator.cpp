 * @brief This file provides the definition of the epuck wheels actuator.
 *
 * This file provides the definition of the epuck wheels actuator.
 * This actuator sets the speed of the wheels. On the real ropuck, the speed is
 * set by a PID controller, which has a specific period here referred to as
 * T_PID. The actual value accepted by the ropuck as speed is expressed in pulse
 * per pid period.
 * In the common interface, the user can specify the linear velocity of the ropuck,
 * that is the distance covered by the ropuck (in cm) per second. This value is
 * related to the pulse input to the motors. Therefore, here we provide conversion
 * factors that are also used in other related sensors, such as the epuck wheel
 * speed sensor and the epuck encoder sensor.
